    "# Fancy Indexing\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw how to access and modify portions of arrays using\n",
    "simple indices (e.g., `arr[0]`), slices (e.g., `arr[:5]`), and Boolean masks (e.g., `arr[arr> 0]`). In this section, we’ll look at another style of array indexing, known as fancy\n",
    "indexing. Fancy indexing is like the simple indexing we’ve already seen, but we pass\n",
    "arrays of indices in place of single scalars. This allows us to very quickly access and\n",
    "modify complicated subsets of an array’s values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Fancy Indexing\n",
    "Fancy indexing is conceptually simple: it means passing an array of indices to access\n",
    "multiple array elements at once. For example, consider the following array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[1]: import numpy as np\n",
    " rand = np.random.RandomState(42)\n",
    " x = rand.randint(100, size=10)\n",
    " print(x)\n",
    "[51 92 14 71 60 20 82 86 74 74]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Suppose we want to access three different elements. We could do it like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[2]: [x[3], x[7], x[2]]\n",
    "Out[2]: [71, 86, 14]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, we can pass a single list or array of indices to obtain the same result:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[3]: ind = [3, 7, 4]\n",
    " x[ind]\n",
    "Out[3]: array([71, 86, 60])\n",
    "```\n",
    "With fancy indexing, the shape of the result reflects the shape of the index arrays\n",
    "rather than the shape of the array being indexed:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[4]: ind = np.array([[3, 7],\n",
    " [4, 5]])\n",
    " x[ind]\n",
    "Out[4]: array([[71, 86],\n",
    " [60, 20]])\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Fancy indexing also works in multiple dimensions. Consider the following array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[5]: X = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))\n",
    " X\n",
    "Out[5]: array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3],\n",
    " [ 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    " [ 8, 9, 10, 11]])\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Like with standard indexing, the first index refers to the row, and the second to the\n",
    "column:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[6]: row = np.array([0, 1, 2])\n",
    " col = np.array([2, 1, 3])\n",
    " X[row, col]\n",
    "Out[6]: array([ 2, 5, 11])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that the first value in the result is X[0, 2], the second is X[1, 1], and the\n",
    "third is X[2, 3]. The pairing of indices in fancy indexing follows all the broadcasting\n",
    "rules that were mentioned in “Computation on Arrays: Broadcasting” on page 63. So,\n",
    "for example, if we combine a column vector and a row vector within the indices, we\n",
    "get a two-dimensional result:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[7]: X[row[:, np.newaxis], col]\n",
    "Out[7]: array([[ 2, 1, 3],\n",
    " [ 6, 5, 7],\n",
    " [10, 9, 11]])\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Here, each row value is matched with each column vector, exactly as we saw in broad‐\n",
    "casting of arithmetic operations. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[8]: row[:, np.newaxis] * col\n",
    "Out[8]: array([[0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [2, 1, 3],\n",
    " [4, 2, 6]])\n",
    " ```\n",
    "It is always important to remember with fancy indexing that the return value reflects\n",
    "the broadcasted shape of the indices, rather than the shape of the array being indexed."

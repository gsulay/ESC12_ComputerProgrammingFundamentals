    "# Introducing Pandas Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very basic level, Pandas objects can be thought of as enhanced versions of\n",
    "NumPy structured arrays in which the rows and columns are identified with labels\n",
    "rather than simple integer indices. As we will see during the course of this chapter,\n",
    "Pandas provides a host of useful tools, methods, and functionality on top of the basic\n",
    "data structures, but nearly everything that follows will require an understanding of\n",
    "what these structures are. Thus, before we go any further, let’s introduce these three\n",
    "fundamental Pandas data structures: the Series, DataFrame, and Index.\n",
    "We will start our code sessions with the standard NumPy and Pandas imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[1]: import numpy as np\n",
    " import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Series Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It can be created from a\n",
    "list or array as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[2]: data = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])\n",
    " data\n",
    "Out[2]: 0 0.25\n",
    " 1 0.50\n",
    " 2 0.75\n",
    " 3 1.00\n",
    " dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we see in the preceding output, the Series wraps both a sequence of values and a\n",
    "sequence of indices, which we can access with the values and index attributes. The\n",
    "values are simply a familiar NumPy array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[3]: data.values\n",
    "Out[3]: array([ 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1. ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The index is an array-like object of type pd.Index, which we’ll discuss in more detail\n",
    "momentarily:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[4]: data.index\n",
    "Out[4]: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=4, step=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Like with a NumPy array, data can be accessed by the associated index via the familiar\n",
    "Python square-bracket notation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[5]: data[1]\n",
    "Out[5]: 0.5\n",
    "In[6]: data[1:3]\n",
    "Out[6]: 1 0.50\n",
    " 2 0.75\n",
    " dtype: float64\n",
    " ```\n",
    "As we will see, though, the Pandas Series is much more general and flexible than the\n",
    "one-dimensional NumPy array that it emulates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series as specialized dictionary\n",
    "In this way, you can think of a Pandas Series a bit like a specialization of a Python\n",
    "dictionary. A dictionary is a structure that maps arbitrary keys to a set of arbitrary\n",
    "values, and a Series is a structure that maps typed keys to a set of typed values. This\n",
    "typing is important: just as the type-specific compiled code behind a NumPy array\n",
    "makes it more efficient than a Python list for certain operations, the type information\n",
    "of a Pandas Series makes it much more efficient than Python dictionaries for certain\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "We can make the Series-as-dictionary analogy even more clear by constructing a\n",
    "Series object directly from a Python dictionary:\n",
    "100 | Chapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[11]: population_dict = {'California': 38332521,\n",

    "# The Pandas DataFrame Object\n",
    "The next fundamental structure in Pandas is the DataFrame. Like the Series object\n",
    "discussed in the previous section, the DataFrame can be thought of either as a gener‐\n",
    "alization of a NumPy array, or as a specialization of a Python dictionary. We’ll now\n",
    "take a look at each of these perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame as a generalized NumPy array\n",
    "If a Series is an analog of a one-dimensional array with flexible indices, a DataFrame\n",
    "is an analog of a two-dimensional array with both flexible row indices and flexible\n",
    "column names. Just as you might think of a two-dimensional array as an ordered\n",
    "sequence of aligned one-dimensional columns, you can think of a DataFrame as a\n",
    "sequence of aligned Series objects. Here, by “aligned” we mean that they share the\n",
    "same index.\n",
    "To demonstrate this, let’s first construct a new Series listing the area of each of the\n",
    "five states discussed in the previous section:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[18]:\n",
    "area_dict = {'California': 423967, 'Texas': 695662, 'New York': 141297,\n",
    " 'Florida': 170312, 'Illinois': 149995}\n",
    "area = pd.Series(area_dict)\n",
    "area\n",
    "Out[18]: California 423967\n",
    " Florida 170312\n",
    " Illinois 149995\n",
    " New York 141297\n",
    " Texas 695662\n",
    " dtype: int64\n",
    " ```\n",
    " Now that we have this along with the population Series from before, we can use a\n",
    "dictionary to construct a single two-dimensional object containing this information:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[19]: states = pd.DataFrame({'population': population,\n",
    " 'area': area})\n",
    " states\n",
    "Out[19]: area population\n",
    " California     423967 38332521\n",
    " Florida        170312 19552860\n",
    " Illinois       149995 12882135\n",
    " New York       141297 19651127\n",
    " Texas          695662 26448193\n",
    "```\n",
    "Like the Series object, the DataFrame has an index attribute that gives access to the\n",
    "index labels:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[20]: states.index\n",
    "Out[20]:\n",
    "Index(['California', 'Florida', 'Illinois', 'New York', 'Texas'], dtype='object')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the DataFrame has a columns attribute, which is an Index object holding\n",
    "the column labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[21]: states.columns\n",
    "Out[21]: Index(['area', 'population'], dtype='object')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thus the DataFrame can be thought of as a generalization of a two-dimensional\n",
    "NumPy array, where both the rows and columns have a generalized index for accessing the data.\n",

    "# Data Indexing and Selection\n",
    "In Chapter 2, we looked in detail at methods and tools to access, set, and modify val‐\n",
    "ues in NumPy arrays. These included indexing (e.g., `arr[2, 1]`), slicing (e.g., `arr[:,1:5]`), masking (e.g., `arr[arr > 0]`), fancy indexing (e.g., `arr[0, [1, 5]]`), and\n",
    "combinations thereof (e.g., `arr[:, [1, 5]]`). Here we’ll look at similar means of\n",
    "accessing and modifying values in Pandas Series and DataFrame objects. If you have\n",
    "used the NumPy patterns, the corresponding patterns in Pandas will feel very famil‐\n",
    "iar, though there are a few quirks to be aware of.\n",
    "We’ll start with the simple case of the one-dimensional Series object, and then move\n",
    "on to the more complicated two-dimensional DataFrame object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Selection in Series\n",
    "As we saw in the previous section, a Series object acts in many ways like a one￾dimensional NumPy array, and in many ways like a standard Python dictionary. If we\n",
    "keep these two overlapping analogies in mind, it will help us to understand the pat‐\n",
    "terns of data indexing and selection in these arrays.\n",
    "Series as dictionary\n",
    "Like a dictionary, the Series object provides a mapping from a collection of keys to a\n",
    "collection of values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[1]:  import pandas as pd\n",
    "        data = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0],\n",
    "        index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])\n",
    "        data\n",
    "Out[1]: a 0.25\n",
    "        b 0.50\n",
    "        c 0.75\n",
    "        d 1.00\n",
    "        dtype: float64\n",
    "In[2]:  data['b']\n",
    "Out[2]: 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also use dictionary-like Python expressions and methods to examine the\n",
    "keys/indices and values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[3]   : 'a' in data\n",
    "Out[3]  : True\n",
    "\n",
    "In[4]   : data.keys()\n",
    "Out[4]  : Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype='object')\n",
    "\n",
    "In[5]   : list(data.items())\n",
    "Out[5]  : [('a', 0.25), ('b', 0.5), ('c', 0.75), ('d', 1.0)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Series objects can even be modified with a dictionary-like syntax. Just as you can\n",
    "extend a dictionary by assigning to a new key, you can extend a Series by assigning\n",
    "to a new index value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[6]:  data['e'] = 1.25\n",
    "        data\n",
    "Out[6]: a 0.25\n",

    "        dtype: float64\n",
    " ```\n",
    "This easy mutability of the objects is a convenient feature: under the hood, Pandas is\n",
    "making decisions about memory layout and data copying that might need to take\n",
    "place; the user generally does not need to worry about these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexers: loc, iloc, and ix\n",
    "These slicing and indexing conventions can be a source of confusion. For example, if\n",
    "your Series has an explicit integer index, an indexing operation such as `data[1]` will\n",
    "use the explicit indices, while a slicing operation like `data[1:3]` will use the implicit\n",

    "```python\n",
    "In[11]: data = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'], index=[1, 3, 5])\n",

    "                dtype: object\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Because of this potential confusion in the case of integer indexes, Pandas provides\n",
    "some special indexer attributes that explicitly expose certain indexing schemes. These\n",
    "are not functional methods, but attributes that expose a particular slicing interface to\n",
    "the data in the Series.\n",
    "First, the loc attribute allows indexing and slicing that always references the explicit\n",

    "```python\n",

    "Out[14]:        'a'\n",

    "One guiding principle of Python code is that “explicit is better than implicit.” The\n",

    " Florida        170312 19552860 114.806121\n",
    " Illinois       149995 12882135 85.883763\n",

    "# Handling Missing Data\n",
    "The difference between data found in many tutorials and data in the real world is that\n",
    "real-world data is rarely clean and homogeneous. In particular, many interesting\n",
    "datasets will have some amount of data missing. To make matters even more compli‐\n",
    "cated, different data sources may indicate missing data in different ways.\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss some general considerations for missing data, discuss\n",
    "how Pandas chooses to represent it, and demonstrate some built-in Pandas tools for\n",
    "handling missing data in Python. Here and throughout the book, we’ll refer to miss‐\n",
    "ing data in general as null, NaN, or NA values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NaN and None in Pandas\n",
    "NaN and None both have their place, and Pandas is built to handle the two of them\n",
    "nearly interchangeably, converting between them where appropriate:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[10]: pd.Series([1, np.nan, 2, None])\n",
    "Out[10]: 0 1.0\n",
    " 1 NaN\n",
    " 2 2.0\n",
    " 3 NaN\n",
    " dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "For types that don’t have an available sentinel value, Pandas automatically type-casts\n",
    "when NA values are present. For example, if we set a value in an integer array to\n",
    "np.nan, it will automatically be upcast to a floating-point type to accommodate the\n",
    "NA:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[11]: x = pd.Series(range(2), dtype=int)\n",
    " x\n",
    "Out[11]: 0 0\n",
    " 1 1\n",
    " dtype: int64\n",
    "\n",
    "In[12]: x[0] = None\n",
    " x\n",
    "Out[12]: 0 NaN\n",
    " 1 1.0\n",
    " dtype: float64\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Notice that in addition to casting the integer array to floating point, Pandas automati‐\n",
    "cally converts the None to a NaN value. (Be aware that there is a proposal to add a\n",
    "native integer NA to Pandas in the future; as of this writing, it has not been included.)\n",
    "While this type of magic may feel a bit hackish compared to the more unified\n",
    "approach to NA values in domain-specific languages like R, the Pandas sentinel/cast‐\n",

    "\n",
    "## Operating on Null Values\n",
    "As we have seen, Pandas treats None and NaN as essentially interchangeable for indi‐\n",
    "cating missing or null values. To facilitate this convention, there are several useful\n",
    "methods for detecting, removing, and replacing null values in Pandas data structures.\n",
    "They are:\n",
    "* `isnull()`\n",
    "    Generate a Boolean mask indicating missing values\n",
    "* `notnull()`\n",
    "    Opposite of isnull()\n",
    "* `dropna()`\n",
    "    Return a filtered version of the data\n",
    "* `fillna()`\n",
    "    Return a copy of the data with missing values filled or imputed\n",
    "We will conclude this section with a brief exploration and demonstration of these\n",
    "routines.\n",
    "Detecting null values\n",
    "Pandas data structures have two useful methods for detecting null data: `isnull()` and\n",
    "`notnull()`. Either one will return a Boolean mask over the data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[13]: data = pd.Series([1, np.nan, 'hello', None])\n",
    "In[14]: data.isnull()\n",
    "Out[14]:    0 False\n",
    "            1 True\n",
    "            2 False\n",
    "            3 True\n",
    "            dtype: bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "As mentioned in “Data Indexing and Selection”, Boolean masks can be\n",
    "used directly as a Series or DataFrame index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[15]: data[data.notnull()]\n",
    "Out[15]:    0 1\n",
    "            2 hello\n",
    "            dtype: object\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `isnull()` and `notnull()` methods produce similar Boolean results for Data\n",
    "Frames.\n",
    "### Dropping null values\n",
    "In addition to the masking used before, there are the convenience methods, `dropna()`\n",
    "(which removes NA values) and `fillna()` (which fills in NA values). For a Series,\n",
    "the result is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[16]: data.dropna()\n",
    "Out[16]:    0 1\n",
    "            2 hello\n",
    "            dtype: object\n",
    "```\n",
    "For a DataFrame, there are more options. Consider the following DataFrame:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[17]: df = pd.DataFrame([ [1, np.nan, 2],\n",
    "                            [2, 3, 5],\n",
    "                            [np.nan, 4, 6]])\n",
    "        df\n",
    "Out[17]:    0 1 2\n",
    "            0 1.0 NaN 2\n",
    "            1 2.0 3.0 5\n",
    "            2 NaN 4.0 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "We cannot drop single values from a DataFrame; we can only drop full rows or full\n",
    "columns. Depending on the application, you might want one or the other, so\n",
    "`dropna()` gives a number of options for a DataFrame.\n",
    "By default, `dropna()` will drop all rows in which any null value is present:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[18]  : df.dropna()\n",
    "Out[18] :     0 1 2\n",
    "            1 2.0 3.0 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you can drop NA values along a different axis; `axis=1` drops all col‐\n",
    "umns containing a null value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[19]: df.dropna(axis='columns')\n",
    "Out[19]:      2\n",
    "            0 2\n",
    "            1 5\n",
    "            2 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "But this drops some good data as well; you might rather be interested in dropping\n",
    "rows or columns with all NA values, or a majority of NA values. This can be specified\n",
    "through the how or thresh parameters, which allow fine control of the number of\n",
    "nulls to allow through.\n",
    "The default is `how='any'`, such that any row or column (depending on the axis key‐\n",
    "word) containing a null value will be dropped. You can also specify `how='all'`, which\n",
    "will only drop rows/columns that are all null values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[20]: df[3] = np.nan\n",
    "        df\n",
    "Out[20]:  0 1 2 3\n",
    "        0 1.0 NaN 2 NaN\n",
    "        1 2.0 3.0 5 NaN\n",
    "        2 NaN 4.0 6 NaN\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In[21]:     df.dropna(axis='columns', how='all')\n",
    "Out[21]:      0 1 2\n",
    "            0 1.0 NaN 2\n",
    "            1 2.0 3.0 5\n",
    "            2 NaN 4.0 6\n",
    " ```\n",
    "For finer-grained control, the thresh parameter lets you specify a minimum number\n",
    "of non-null values for the row/column to be kept:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[22]:     df.dropna(axis='rows', thresh=3)\n",
    "Out[22]:      0 1 2 3\n",
    "            1 2.0 3.0 5 NaN\n",
